# Capstone-Design-Technical-Project-I-II

In Capstone Design Technical Project 1 and 2, students use their knowledge and experience 
gained from previous courses and/or internships to design and prototype a product. 
Throughout this journey, our team (reVOLT) was supervised by an SFU professor, and sponsored
by an independent startup company (Green Waterways Ltd.). 

Due to an NDA signed, we have to wait for their approval for what can be shared on this public 
repository. In short, we have been responsible for developing an Ingress-Protected (IP) battery 
pack with an integrated battery management system (BMS) for a boat. This involved designing
schematics in KiCAD, market research, weekly meetings with sponsors to discuss BOM. At this
stage, we are working on developing a GUI, completing KiCAD schematics and actually building 
the physical prouct.

This is a very interesting project and more files/reports might be added if our sponsors
approve for some information to be shared be public.
